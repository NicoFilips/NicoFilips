### Hi there 👋
# 💫I'm Nico Filips, A Backend Developer from Augsburg, Germany.
- 🏁 I'm working for a big sportscar brand in Germany
- 🎮 I love trackmania E-Sports
- 🌱 I’ve been building React SPA's, but I'm a bit rusty so I'm here to update my skills
- 🔒 Since I've been working on closed software my entire career, my contribution graph doesn't really portray my real contributions
- 📝 I'm a .Net/C# Backend Dev, pretty much doing everything from implementing APIs to writing Tests
- ☁️ For me its really enjoyable to work with Azure so that's why I got some Azure projects as well
